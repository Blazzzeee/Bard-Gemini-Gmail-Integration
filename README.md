# Bard-Gemini-Gmail-Integration


The project is built in python3 using open source libraries including bardapi,MIME Multi mime 

The script allows the user to scrape the contents of a mail box that are under the AI-Label folder,the script securely downloads the first or "latest" mail,and passes it to google AI gemini or bard and pushes the mail into user's draft folder ready to send after inspecting


The script requires python3 or python interpreter to execute, to automate this script i recommend using windows task scheduler and changing the Python Interpreter as the file to run, the user can set triggers accordingly as per his/her needs. The code does terminates in case the label is empty.

Also during the operation of the script the browser should be logged in with the google account that you will be using to parse the response to i recommend using Firefox.

For any confussions and issues refer to the official documentation of the libraries used or contact the developer.

I'd be happy if this program adds a bit of convenience in your life.....
